properties:
  homeMobileCountryCode:
    type: integer
    description: The cell tower's Mobile Country Code (MCC).
  homeMobileNetworkCode:
    type: integer
    description:
      The cell tower's Mobile Network Code. This is the MNC for GSM and
      WCDMA; CDMA uses the System ID (SID).
  radioType:
    type: string
    description: The mobile radio type. Supported values are lte, gsm, cdma, and wcdma. While this field is optional, it should be included if a value is available, for more accurate results.
  carrier:
    type: string
    description: The carrier name.
  considerIp:
    type: string
    description: Specifies whether to fall back to IP geolocation if wifi and cell tower signals are not available. Defaults to true. Set considerIp to false to disable fall back.
  cellTowers:
    type: array
    description: An array of cell tower objects.
    items:
      type: object
      required:
        - cellId
        - locationAreaCode
        - mobileCountryCode
        - mobileNetworkCode
      properties:
        cellId:
          description:
            Unique identifier of the cell. On GSM, this is the Cell ID (CID);
            CDMA networks use the Base Station ID (BID). WCDMA networks use the
            UTRAN/GERAN Cell Identity (UC-Id), which is a 32-bit value
            concatenating the Radio Network Controller (RNC) and Cell ID.
            Specifying only the 16-bit Cell ID value in WCDMA networks may
            return inaccurate results.
          type: integer
        locationAreaCode:
          description:
            The Location Area Code (LAC) for GSM and WCDMA networks. The
            Network ID (NID) for CDMA networks.
          type: integer
        mobileCountryCode:
          description: The cell tower's Mobile Country Code (MCC).
          type: integer
        mobileNetworkCode:
          description:
            The cell tower's Mobile Network Code. This is the MNC for GSM and
            WCDMA; CDMA uses the System ID (SID).
          type: integer
        age:
          description:
            The number of milliseconds since this cell was primary. If age is
            0, the cellId represents a current measurement.
          type: integer
        signalStrength:
          description: Radio signal strength measured in dBm.
          type: number
        timingAdvance:
          description: The timing advance value.
          type: number
