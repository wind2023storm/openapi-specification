      properties:
        cellId:
          description: Unique identifier of the cell. On GSM, this is the Cell ID (CID);
            CDMA networks use the Base Station ID (BID). WCDMA networks use the
            UTRAN/GERAN Cell Identity (UC-Id), which is a 32-bit value
            concatenating the Radio Network Controller (RNC) and Cell ID.
            Specifying only the 16-bit Cell ID value in WCDMA networks may
            return inaccurate results.
          type: integer
        locationAreaCode:
          description: The Location Area Code (LAC) for GSM and WCDMA networks. The
            Network ID (NID) for CDMA networks.
          type: integer
        mobileCountryCode:
          description: The cell tower's Mobile Country Code (MCC).
          type: integer
        mobileNetworkCode:
          description: The cell tower's Mobile Network Code. This is the MNC for GSM and
            WCDMA; CDMA uses the System ID (SID).
          type: integer
        age:
          description: The number of milliseconds since this cell was primary. If age is
            0, the cellId represents a current measurement.
