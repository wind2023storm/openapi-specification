        A unique identifier that can be used with other Google APIs. For
        example, you can use the place_id in a Places API request to get details
        of a local business, such as phone number, opening hours, user reviews,
        and more. See the place ID overview.

        The types[] array indicates the type of the returned result. This array
        contains a set of zero or more tags identifying the type of feature
        returned in the result. For example, a geocode of "Chicago" returns
        "locality" which indicates that "Chicago" is a city, and also returns
        "political" which indicates it is a political entity.

        Indicates that the geocoder did not return an exact match for the
        original request, though it was able to match part of the requested
        address. You may wish to examine the original request for misspellings
        and/or an incomplete address.Partial matches most often occur for street
        addresses that do not exist within the locality you pass in the request.
        Partial matches may also be returned when a request matches two or more
        locations in the same locality.
