        A string containing the human-readable address of this place.Often this
        address is equivalent to the postal address. Note that some countries,
        such as the United Kingdom, do not allow distribution of true postal
        addresses due to licensing restrictions.The formatted address is
        logically composed of one or more address components. For example, the
        address "111 8th Avenue, New York, NY" consists of the following
        components: "111" (the street number), "8th Avenue" (the route), "New
        York" (the city) and "NY" (the US state).Do not parse the formatted
        address programmatically. Instead you should use the individual address
        components, which the API response includes in addition to the formatted
        address field.
