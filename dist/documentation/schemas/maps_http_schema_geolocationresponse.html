  A successful geolocation request will return a JSON-formatted response
  defining a location and radius.

        The accuracy of the estimated location, in meters. This represents the
        radius of a circle around the given location. If your Geolocation
        response shows a very high value in the accuracy field, the service may
        be geolocating based on the request IP, instead of WiFi points or cell
        towers. This can happen if no cell towers or access points are valid or
        recognized. To confirm that this is the issue, set considerIp to false
        in your request. If the response is a 404, you've confirmed that your
        wifiAccessPoints and cellTowers objects could not be geolocated.
