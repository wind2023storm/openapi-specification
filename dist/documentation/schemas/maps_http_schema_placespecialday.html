        True if there are exceptional hours for this day. If true, this means
        that there is at least one exception for this day. Exceptions cause
        different values to occur in the subfields of current_opening_hours and
        secondary_opening_hours such as periods, weekday_text, open_now. The
        exceptions apply to the hours, and the hours are used to generate the
        other fields.
