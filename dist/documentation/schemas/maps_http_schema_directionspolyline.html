    >Polyline encoding</a
  >
  is a lossy compression algorithm that allows you to store a series of
  coordinates as a single string. Point coordinates are encoded using signed
  values. If you only have a few static points, you may also wish to use the
  interactive polyline encoding utility.
</p>
<p>
  The encoding process converts a binary value into a series of character codes
  for ASCII characters using the familiar base64 encoding scheme: to ensure
  proper display of these characters, encoded values are summed with 63 (the
  ASCII character '?') before converting them into ASCII. The algorithm also
  checks for additional character codes for a given point by checking the least
  significant bit of each byte group; if this bit is set to 1, the point is not
  yet fully formed and additional data must follow.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, to conserve space, points only include the offset from the
  previous point (except of course for the first point). All points are encoded
  in Base64 as signed integers, as latitudes and longitudes are signed values.
  The encoding format within a polyline needs to represent two coordinates
  representing latitude and longitude to a reasonable precision. Given a maximum
  longitude of +/- 180 degrees to a precision of 5 decimal places (180.00000 to
  -180.00000), this results in the need for a 32 bit signed binary integer
  value.
