        Indicates that the geocoder did not return an exact match for the
        original request, though it was able to match part of the requested
        address. You may wish to examine the original request for misspellings
        and/or an incomplete address.Partial matches most often occur for street
        addresses that do not exist within the locality you pass in the request.
        Partial matches may also be returned when a request matches two or more
        locations in the same locality. For example, "21 Henr St, Bristol, UK"
        will return a partial match for both Henry Street and Henrietta Street.
        Note that if a request includes a misspelled address component, the
        geocoding service may suggest an alternative address. Suggestions
        triggered in this way will also be marked as a partial match.

        Indicates the address type of the geocoding result used for calculating
        directions.administrative_area_level_1 indicates a first-order civil
        entity below the country level. Within the United States, these
        administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these
        administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short
        names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely
        circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding
        results are based on a variety of signals and location
        data.administrative_area_level_2 indicates a second-order civil entity
        below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative
        levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative
        levels.administrative_area_level_3 indicates a third-order civil entity
        below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not
        all nations exhibit these administrative
        levels.administrative_area_level_4 indicates a fourth-order civil entity
        below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not
        all nations exhibit these administrative
        levels.administrative_area_level_5 indicates a fifth-order civil entity
        below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not
        all nations exhibit these administrative levels.airport indicates an
        airport.colloquial_area indicates a commonly-used alternative name for
        the entity.country indicates the national political entity, and is
        typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.intersection
        indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads.locality
        indicates an incorporated city or town political entity.natural_feature
        indicates a prominent natural feature.neighborhood indicates a named
        neighborhoodpark indicates a named park.plus_code indicates an encoded
        location reference, derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can
        be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do
        not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named).
        See <a href="https://plus.codes">https://plus.codes</a> for
        details.point_of_interest indicates a named point of interest.
        Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily
        fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Eiffel
        Tower".political indicates a political entity. Usually, this type
        indicates a polygon of some civil administration.postal_code indicates a
        postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.premise
        indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of

        101").street_address indicates a precise street address.sublocality
        indicates a first-order civil entity below a locality. For some
        locations may receive one of the additional types: sublocality_level_1
        to sublocality_level_5. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger
        numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.subpremise indicates a
        first-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building
        within a collection of buildings with a common nametourist_attraction
        indicates a tourist attraction.train_station indicates a train
        station.transit_station indicates a transit station.An empty list of
