        May contain a pair of day and time objects describing when the place
        closes. If a place is always open, the close section will be missing
        from the response. Clients can rely on always-open being represented as
        an open period containing day with value 0 and time with value 0000, and
        no close.See PlaceOpeningHoursPeriodDetail for more information.
