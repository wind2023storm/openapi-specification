        Contains an array of available travel modes. This field is returned when
        a request specifies a travel mode and gets no results. The array
        contains the available travel modes in the countries of the given set of
        waypoints. This field is not returned if one or more of the waypoints
        are 'via waypoints'.See TravelMode for more information.

        When the service returns a status code other than OK, there may be an

        status code. This field is not always returned, and its content is

      </td>
      <td>
        Contains an array with details about the geocoding of origin,
        destination and waypoints. Elements in the geocoded_waypoints array
        correspond, by their zero-based position, to the origin, the waypoints
        in the order they are specified, and the destination.These details will
        not be present for waypoints specified as textual latitude/longitude
        values if the service returns no results. This is because such waypoints
        are only reverse geocoded to obtain their representative address after a
        route has been found. An empty JSON object will occupy the corresponding
        places in the geocoded_waypoints array.See DirectionsGeocodedWaypoint
        for more information.
