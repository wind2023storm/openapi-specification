  An encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude
  coordinates, that represents an area, 1/8000th of a degree by 1/8000th of a
  degree (about 14m x 14m at the equator) or smaller. Plus codes can be used as
  a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where
  buildings are not numbered or streets are not named).
