      The path to be snapped. The path parameter accepts a list of
      latitude/longitude pairs. Latitude and longitude values should be
      separated by commas. Coordinates should be separated by the pipe
      character: "|". For example:
      <code
        >path=60.170880,24.942795|60.170879,24.942796|60.170877,24.942796</code
      >.

  <li>
    <p>
      Whether to interpolate a path to include all points forming the full
      road-geometry. When true, additional interpolated points will also be
      returned, resulting in a path that smoothly follows the geometry of the
      road, even around corners and through tunnels. Interpolated paths will
      most likely contain more points than the original path. Defaults to
      <code>false</code>.
