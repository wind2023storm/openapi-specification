<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Indicates the compass heading of the camera. Accepted values are from 0 to
      360 (both values indicating North, with 90 indicating East, and 180
      South). If no heading is specified, a value will be calculated that
      directs the camera towards the specified location, from the point at which
      the closest photograph was taken.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The point around which to retrieve place information. The Street View
      Static API will snap to the panorama photographed closest to this
      location. When an address text string is provided, the API may use a
      different camera location to better display the specified location. When a
      lat/lng is provided, the API searches a 50 meter radius for a photograph
      closest to this location. Because Street View imagery is periodically
      refreshed, and photographs may be taken from slightly different positions
      each time, it's possible that your <code>location</code> may snap to a
      different panorama when imagery is updated.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A specific panorama ID. These are generally stable, though panoramas may
      change ID over time as imagery is refreshed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specifies the up or down angle of the camera relative to the Street View
      vehicle. This is often, but not always, flat horizontal. Positive values
      angle the camera up (with 90 degrees indicating straight up); negative
      values angle the camera down (with -90 indicating straight down). Default
      is 0.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sets a radius, specified in meters, in which to search for a panorama,
      centered on the given latitude and longitude. Valid values are
      non-negative integers. Default is 50 meters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Indicates whether the API should return a non <code>200 Ok</code> HTTP
      status when no image is found (<code>404 NOT FOUND</code>), or in response
      to an invalid request (400 BAD REQUEST). Valid values are
      <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. If set to <code>true</code>, an
      error message is returned in place of the generic gray image. This
      eliminates the need to make a separate call to check for image
      availability.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A digital signature used to verify that any site generating requests using
      your API key is authorized to do so. Requests that do not include a
      digital signature might fail. For more information, see

        href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/get-api-key"

      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specifies the output size of the image in pixels. Size is specified as
      <code>{width}x{height}</code> - for example,
      <code>size=600x400</code> returns an image 600 pixels wide, and 400 high.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limits Street View searches to selected sources. Valid values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>default</code> uses the default sources for Street View; searches
        are not limited to specific sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>outdoor</code> limits searches to outdoor collections. Indoor
        collections are not included in search results. Note that outdoor
        panoramas may not exist for the specified location. Also note that the
        search only returns panoramas where it's possible to determine whether
        they're indoors or outdoors. For example, PhotoSpheres are not returned
        because it's unknown whether they are indoors or outdoors.
      </li>
